Run main.py to process the data from your sensors.
By default, main.py will use the timeclear data processing method, as the sensors are assumed to be out of sync in time.
If the sensors are synced in time accurately, then make changes to main.py before you run it to use the regular data processing file.
This will use standard timestamps, rather than the zeroed timestamps.
