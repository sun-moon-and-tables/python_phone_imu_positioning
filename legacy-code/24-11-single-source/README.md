This folder contains the current software for processing IMU gravity (that's from a virtual sensor) and accelerometer data.
The app to send the data is not on GitHub currently, but is saved to the Lancaster Box.
To run this hodge podge of programs:
1) run the packet processor
2) run the gravity sync
3) run the integration and plotting

The packet processor program requires the input of a .csv test data file, which you'll have to save using the app and ncat.
You'll need to specify the location of the .csv file.
